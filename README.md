# Ember Todo MVC using the Ember App Kit .

Trying to learn Ember and thought this would be a fun exercise. The process is a bit different than the official guide and I used [this](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit-todos) as a map for my build. Considering writing a short addenedum to the official guides so noobs like me that want to get started with EAK don't have to spelunk through a bunch of unfamiiar code.

## Things I'd like to add as exercises

* Moving to Broccoli and Ember-Cli
* Adding Hoodie as a backend and making the app multi user
* Pages of todos for grouping and orginization
